## Approach: 
We followed the code first approach, created Entities, their attributes, established relationships and these entities were migrated to database as tables. 

Below are the entities used:

*	Property table – Consists of details of different buildings in the vicinity or on a street. 

*	Tenant table – consists of details of the unit like unit number, resident id, no of bedrooms, no of washrooms, pet allowed, in unit laundry facility available.

*	Staff Table – Management Staff and Maintenance Staff are responsible for overall management of units in respective buildings. Management staff takes care of lease details, payments, inspection checks and maintenance requests logged, if any. Maintenance Staff is responsible for servicing or repairing items found during maintenance requests logged or during inspection checks.


*	Inspection checks – This table is designed to serve the purpose that all inspection checks are tracked and if any observation is found then they can be used for corrections or warnings to be given to residents.

*	MaintenanceRequests – This table helps to keep track of maintenance requests logged and ensure that they are being serviced by the maintenance staff on time.

*	Lease: It keeps a track of lease details agreed between management company and tenant Id. It has attributes like lease id, lease term, lease start and end date etc. 

* Payment:  This helps in keeping track of payment details such as monthly rent, deposit, pet deposit, total payment amount etc. 

*	Security deposit returns: This helps in keeping track of expired leases and management company is now responsible for repayment of security deposits which they took from the residents during the start of the lease. 


### Users :

1)	Admin: This user is part of the staff who can login and check maintenance requests logged, inspection checks. 
2)	LandLord : This user can perform  CRUD on Properties.
3)	Tenant : This is a user staying in a  property. They can login and check all the details related to them and maintenance requests logged by them. 

##### _points to note_

- You must supply your connection string,before you can have have access to the migrations.
- You must Update Database to use the migrated entities in the database.
-  Then Run the WebAPI (recommeneded to run from visual studio)

### Known Errors:

- If any error pops up regarding namespaces, add the reference to the DataAccess project or dll from the webapi project
